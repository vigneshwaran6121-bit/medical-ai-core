# Medical AI Core

This repository documents my 90-day learning path in Medical AI.

## Phase 1: Foundations
- Medical image formats (DICOM, NIfTI)
- PyTorch tensors and datasets
- Custom DataLoader for 3D medical volumes
- Basic preprocessing (resize, normalize)
- Git and clean code practices

## Current Focus
- 3D medical image segmentation (CT scans)
- PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader design

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- NiBabel, pydicom
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Dataset
- Task09_Spleen (not included in repo)
